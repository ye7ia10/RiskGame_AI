STEPS:
  1- create first state and fill it with the initial data after calling assignTerritories function
  2- fill the state obj by looping over the territories and getting each territory's ownerNumber and armyCount
  3- for the stateString in State => append all the ownerNumbers from the territories
  4- for the armiesList in State => add all armiesCount from the territories
  5- When changing from one state to another
    => create new state
    => new stateString = oldState.stateString & change the owner of whatever territory attacked
    => new armiesList = oldState.armiesList.clone() & change whatever armies changed

State: Class 
    => String containing the current assignment of all territories in order. ex=> 01100100100100110110...
    => ArrayList<Integer> Armies [-1,10,2,3,5,10,20]
    => Parent State

States from each State
  forEach place i have => add the bonus
    forEach Enimy i have
      forEach number of armies i can attack with
        try to attack

G: Calculate how many territory i own and will be defeated

H: Number of enimies territories
